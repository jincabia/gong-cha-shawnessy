                            Gong cha brews four types of classic tea: Black tea, Green tea, Oolong tea, and Earl Grey tea. Using only loose leaf tea leaves, these teas are brewed at just the right temperature for just the right amount of time. Because each type of tea has its own unique brewing process, precision is essential in order to extract the different taste profiles of each tea to ensure the best quality and flavour. Gong cha offers a wide selection of the very best toppings, including pearls and various jellies, to pair with these teas.
